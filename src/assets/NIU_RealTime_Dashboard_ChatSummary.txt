- Alerts stored in DB (alert severity & contributor info)
- Task logging API and timeline-based filtering
- `.env` setup and DB schema creation included

✔ Frontend (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion):
- Dynamic graphs (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Temp)
- Contributor-specific metrics display
- Alert logging and historical alerts timeline
- Task timeline with API integration
- Dark/light mode toggle
- NIU branding (logo integration)
- Production-like UI enhancements (cards, charts, layout)

✔ Final Enhancements:
- Modular CSS design with clean class-based styling
- Added Framer Motion animations
- Alert messages and escalation logic
- Render-deployed backend and local frontend dev
- PPT generation for presentation

Next Steps (Completed or Optional):
- Screenshots and videos for demo sections
- Optional feature ideas like user auth, real-time websockets, filtering, export, etc.
- PPT slide deck provided

The full implementation was reviewed line-by-line, with complete file updates provided (App.jsx, main.py, App.css). Let us know if you need the final GitHub push script or a README file template.
